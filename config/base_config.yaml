# Core assumptions for the simulation

capacity_cost: 5.0     # cost per kW of peak capacity ie. how much it cost to provide enough network capacity
                       # to meet the maximum electricity demand

elasticity:
  demand_reduction: 0.05   # % total usage reduction per unit price increase
  demand_shift: 0.15       # % load that can move to off-peak times

opt_in:
  rule: "bill_lower_only"  # customer opts in only if bill decreases
  default_rate: 0.30       # expected opt-in proportion
